## How does it work?

[Full article](https://single-spa.js.org/docs/recommended-setup)

This repository contains an [import map](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps/) that controls the shared libraries between all microfrontends. The full, deployed import map is visible at https://shared-deps.edenfarm.tech/importmap.json.

Deployments for this project are completely independent of deployments for any other module.
